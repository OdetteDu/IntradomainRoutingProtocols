How to test the alarm setting and handling:

1. get into directory interface ($ cd interface)
2. build the simulator ($ make)
3. run the simulator ($ ./Simulator simpletest{1,2,3} DV|LS)
	(Any test will work, protocol, DV or LS, doesn't matter at this time)
4. see the result generated by simulator
	(should print corresponding message generated by handle_alarm)
	(About the message generated by the simulator itself, there are some inconsistent information about the node ID. I asked about this on PIAZZA already. Check it out if there are answers online)

Please contact me if you find any error or bug.
