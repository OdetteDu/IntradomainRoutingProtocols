definitions of all generic data structures can be found in "Port.h"

Port:
	Every port is represented by a class Port.
	In implementation, the pointer "ports" points to the array of all ports.

Forwarding table:
	Every entry is an element of the linked list whose head is pointed by "forwards".
	Function fineForward(dest) will return the entry pointer which has destID the same as parameter dest, or NULL if entry not found.
	Function updateForward(destID, nextID) will update or create one entry of the list, and set it as "alive".
	Function killForward(destID) will set the entry which contains destID as "not alive".
